# Change Log

All notable changes to this project are documented below.

The format is based on [keep a changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/) and this project uses [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).

### [2.7.0] - [2023-02-15]

### Changed
- Removed ability to create default client and realtime clients if no default transport is specified for the platform (`createDefaultClient`, `createDefaultRtClient`). This will only affect users who use vcpkg or CMake to explicitly toggle off our default transports.
