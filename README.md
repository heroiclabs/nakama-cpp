> General C/C++ client for Nakama server.

[Nakama](https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama) is an open-source server designed to power modern games and apps. Features include user accounts, chat, social, matchmaker, realtime multiplayer, and much [more](https://heroiclabs.com).

This client implements the full API and socket options with the server. It's written in C and C++11 with minimal dependencies to support Cocos2d-x, Unreal and other custom engines and frameworks.

If you experience any issues with the client, it can be useful to enable debug logs (see [Logging](#logging) section) and [open an issue](https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama-cpp/issues).

Full documentation is online - https://heroiclabs.com/docs

## Getting Started

You'll need to setup the server and database before you can connect with the client. The simplest way is to use Docker but have a look at the [server documentation](https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama#getting-started) for other options.

1. Install and run the servers. Follow these [instructions](https://heroiclabs.com/docs/install-docker-quickstart).

2. Nakama C/C++ SDK is released with prebuilt libraries for following platforms and architectures:

- Windows - Visual Studio 2015, 2017, 2019 (x86, x64, Debug, Release)
- Android - Android 4.1 (armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a, x86, x86_64)
- Linux - Ubuntu 14.04.5 (x86, x64)
- Mac - 10.10+
- iOS - 5.0+ (arm64, armv7, armv7s, x86_64), Bitcode is off

In theory any platform that meets the requirement for `cpprest` and `boost` is also supported. The client is compiled with C++11.

3. Download the client from the [releases page](https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama-cpp/releases). You can also [build from source](#source-builds).

<!-- You can download clients that are tailored for [Cocos2d-x](https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama-cocos2d-x) or [Unreal 4](https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama-unreal). -->

4. Integrate the client library into your project:

When you've downloaded the Nakama C++ archive and extracted it to `NAKAMA_CPP_SDK` folder, you should include it in your project.

We don't recommend to copy Nakama C++ SDK to your project because it's quite big in size (~1 Gb).

### Setup for Mac and iOS projects

1. Add `NAKAMA_CPP_SDK/include` in `Build Settings > Header Search Paths`

2. Add libs folder in `Build Settings > Library Search Paths`:
    - `NAKAMA_CPP_SDK/libs/ios` - for iOS
    - `NAKAMA_CPP_SDK/libs/mac` - for Mac

3. In `General > Linked Frameworks and Libraries` add following:
    - all `.a` files located in libs folder
    - `foundation` and `security` frameworks

### Setup for Android projects

If you use `CMake` then see [Setup for CMake projects](#setup-for-cmake-projects) section.

If you use `ndk-build` then add following to your `Android.mk` file:

```makefile
# add this to your module
LOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES += nakama-cpp

# add this at bottom of Android.mk file
$(call import-add-path, NAKAMA_CPP_SDK)
$(call import-module, nakama-cpp-android)
```

#### Initialize Nakama SDK

For most NativeActivity projects, if you have an entry point like:

```cpp
void android_main(struct android_app* state) {
```

Add include:

```cpp
#include "nakama-cpp/platform/android/android.h"
```

Add the following code at the top of the `android_main` function:

```cpp
Nakama::init(state->activity->vm);
```

#### Shared library size

Don't be afraid that nakama shared library are near 100 Mb in size. After building final apk it will be just few Mb.

#### Android permissions

Android uses a permissions system which determines which platform services the application will request to use and ask permission for from the user. The client uses the network to communicate with the server so you must add the "INTERNET" permission.

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### Setup for CMake projects

To link Nakama's static lib add following to your `CMakeLists.txt` file:

```cmake
add_subdirectory(NAKAMA_CPP_SDK ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/nakama-cpp)
target_link_libraries(${APP_NAME} ext_nakama-cpp)
```

To link Nakama's shared lib add following to your `CMakeLists.txt` file:

```cmake
set(NAKAMA_SHARED_LIBRARY TRUE)
add_subdirectory(NAKAMA_CPP_SDK ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/nakama-cpp)
target_link_libraries(${APP_NAME} ext_nakama-cpp)
CopyNakamaSharedLib(${APP_NAME})
```

### Setup for Visual Studio projects

In `Project Settings` add following:

1. Add `NAKAMA_CPP_SDK/include` in `C/C++ > General > Additional Include Directories`
2. Add libs folder in `Linker > General > Additional Library Directories`:
    - `NAKAMA_CPP_SDK/libs/win32/v140` - for VS 2015 x86
    - `NAKAMA_CPP_SDK/libs/win64/v140` - for VS 2015 x64
    - `NAKAMA_CPP_SDK/libs/win32/v141` - for VS 2017 x86
    - `NAKAMA_CPP_SDK/libs/win64/v141` - for VS 2017 x64
    - `NAKAMA_CPP_SDK/libs/win32/v142` - for VS 2019 x86
    - `NAKAMA_CPP_SDK/libs/win64/v142` - for VS 2019 x64
3. Add all `.lib` files located in libs folder in `Linker > Input > Additional Dependencies`

### Custom setup

- add define:
  * `NLOGS_ENABLED` - define it if you want to use Nakama logger. See [Logging](#logging) section
- add include directory: `$(NAKAMA_CPP_SDK)/include`
- add link directory: `$(NAKAMA_CPP_SDK)/libs/{platform}/{ABI}`
- add all libraries for linking from link directory

## Threading model

Nakama C++ is designed to use in one thread only.

## Usage

The client object has many methods to execute various features in the server or open realtime socket connections with the server.

Include nakama header.

```cpp
#include "nakama-cpp/Nakama.h"
```

Use nakama namespace.

```cpp
using namespace Nakama;
```

Use the connection credentials to build a client object.

```cpp
NClientParameters parameters;
parameters.serverKey = "defaultkey";
parameters.host = "127.0.0.1";
parameters.port = DEFAULT_PORT;
NClientPtr client = createDefaultClient(parameters);
```

The `createDefaultClient` will create HTTP/1.1 client to use REST API.

### Tick

The `tick` method pumps requests queue and executes callbacks in your thread. You must call it periodically (recommended every 50ms) in your thread.

```cpp
client->tick();
if (rtClient)
    rtClient->tick();
```

Without this the default client and realtime client will not work, and you will not receive responses from the server.

### Authenticate

There's a variety of ways to [authenticate](https://heroiclabs.com/docs/authentication) with the server. Authentication can create a user if they don't already exist with those credentials. It's also easy to authenticate with a social profile from Google Play Games, Facebook, Game Center, etc.

```cpp
string email = "super@heroes.com";
string password = "batsignal";

auto successCallback = [](NSessionPtr session)
{
    std::cout << "session token: " << session->getAuthToken() << std::endl;
};

auto errorCallback = [](const NError& error)
{
};

client->authenticateEmail(email, password, "", false, {}, successCallback, errorCallback);
```

### Sessions

When authenticated the server responds with an auth token (JWT) which contains useful properties and gets deserialized into a `NSession` object.

```cpp
std::cout << session->getAuthToken() << std::endl; // raw JWT token
std::cout << session->getUserId() << std::endl;
std::cout << session->getUsername() << std::endl;
std::cout << "Session has expired: " << session->isExpired() << std::endl;
std::cout << "Session expires at: " << session->getExpireTime() << std::endl;
```

It is recommended to store the auth token from the session and check at startup if it has expired. If the token has expired you must reauthenticate. The expiry time of the token can be changed as a setting in the server.

```cpp
string authtoken = "restored from somewhere";
NSessionPtr session = restoreSession(authtoken);
if (session->isExpired()) {
    std::cout << "Session has expired. Must reauthenticate!" << std::endl;
}
```

### Requests

The client includes lots of builtin APIs for various features of the game server. These can be accessed with the async methods. It can also call custom logic as RPC functions on the server. These can also be executed with a socket object.

All requests are sent with a session object which authorizes the client.

```cpp
auto successCallback = [](const NAccount& account)
{
    std::cout << "user id : " << account.user.id << std::endl;
    std::cout << "username: " << account.user.username << std::endl;
    std::cout << "wallet  : " << account.wallet << std::endl;
};

client->getAccount(session, successCallback, errorCallback);
```

### Realtime client

The client can create one or more realtime clients with the server. Each realtime client can have it's own events listener registered for responses received from the server.

```cpp
bool createStatus = true; // if the socket should show the user as online to others.
// define realtime client in your class as NRtClientPtr rtClient;
rtClient = client->createRtClient(DEFAULT_PORT);
// define listener in your class as NRtDefaultClientListener listener;
listener.setConnectCallback([]()
{
    std::cout << "Socket connected" << std::endl;
});
rtClient->setListener(&listener);
rtClient->connect(session, createStatus);
```

Don't forget to call `tick` method. See [Tick](#tick) section for details.

### Logging

#### Initializing Logger

Client logging is off by default.

To enable logs output to console with debug logging level:

```cpp
NLogger::initWithConsoleSink(NLogLevel::Debug);
```

To enable logs output to custom sink with debug logging level:

```cpp
NLogger::init(sink, NLogLevel::Debug);
```

#### Using Logger

To log string with debug logging level:

```
NLOG_DEBUG("debug log");
```

formatted log:

```
NLOG(NLogLevel::Info, "This is string: %s", "yup I'm string");
NLOG(NLogLevel::Info, "This is int: %d", 5);
```

Changing logging level boundary:

```
NLogger::setLevel(NLogLevel::Debug);
```

`NLogger` behaviour depending on logging level boundary:

- `Debug` writes all logs.

- `Info` writes logs with `Info`, `Warn`, `Error` and `Fatal` logging level.

- `Warn` writes logs with `Warn`, `Error` and `Fatal` logging level.

- `Error` writes logs with `Error` and `Fatal` logging level.

- `Fatal` writes only logs with `Fatal` logging level.

Note: to use logging macroses you have to define `NLOGS_ENABLED`.

### Websockets transport

Nakama C++ client has built-in support for WebSocket. This is available on all supported platforms.

Client will default to use the Websocket transport provided by [C++ REST SDK](https://github.com/microsoft/cpprestsdk).

You can use a custom Websocket transport by implementing the [NRtTransportInterface](https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama-cpp/blob/master/include/nakama-cpp/realtime/NRtTransportInterface.h):

```cpp
rtClient = client->createRtClient(port, websockets_transport);
```

For more code examples, have a look at:

* [NWebsocketCppRest](https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama-cpp/blob/master/src/realtime/NWebsocketCppRest.h)
* [NCocosWebSocket](https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama-cocos2d-x/blob/master/example/Classes/NakamaCocos2d/NCocosWebSocket.h)

#### Activity timeout

Built-in websocket transport supports "Activity timeout" feature - if no any message received from server during "Activity timeout" then connection will be closed. Set 0 to disable this feature (default value).

```cpp
rtClient->getTransport()->setActivityTimeout(20000); // 20 sec
```

You can change ping period on server - `ping_period_ms` parameter:
